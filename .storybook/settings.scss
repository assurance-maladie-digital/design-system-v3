/**
 * Storybook-specific Vuetify settings

 * 
 * IMPORTANT: CSS Layers Limitation in Storybook
 * ============================================
 * 
 * Storybook is fundamentally incompatible with Vuetify's CSS Layers ($layers: true).
 * When CSS Layers are enabled, Storybook's build process doesn't properly handle
 * the layer ordering, causing style conflicts and broken component rendering.
 * 
 * SOLUTION:
 * - Use $layers: false in this Storybook-specific configuration
 * - Keep $layers: true in src/assets/settings.scss for local development
 * - This ensures optimal performance locally while maintaining Storybook compatibility
 * 
 * DO NOT change $layers to true unless you have a solution for the Storybook
 * compatibility issue. This has been tested extensively and is a known limitation.
