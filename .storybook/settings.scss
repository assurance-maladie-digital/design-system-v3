/**
 * Storybook-specific Vuetify settings
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Vuetify CSS Layers ($layers: true) are fundamentally incompatible 
 * with Storybook's build process. This causes style conflicts and broken 
 * component rendering in Storybook.
 * 
 * Solution:
 * - Use $layers: false for Storybook (this file)
 * - Keep $layers: true in src/assets/settings.scss for local development
 * 
 * Do not attempt to enable layers in Storybook - it will not work.
